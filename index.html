		<p>hi, this is the official website for the Harkenburg Minecraft project and the Harkenburg Texture Pack. As you can see, this website is bare. I'm a lad in college, and when college is a thing, personal time is non existant. So please excuse this bare website, it's my intention to get something down but as of right now it's just a domain with a title and a paragraph. Nice</p>
		<p>Thanks for the understanding, -Bluecolty</p>
