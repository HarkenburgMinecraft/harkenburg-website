        <h1>Hi</h1>
		<p>This is the official website for the <strong>Harkenburg Minecraft Project</strong> and the <strong>Harkenburg Texture Pack</strong>. As you can see, this website is bare. I'm a lad in college, and when college is a thing, personal time is non existant. So please excuse this bare website, it's my intention to get something down but as of right now it's just a domain with a title and a paragraph. Nice</p>
		<p>Thanks for the understanding, -Bluecolty</p>
        <p>If you're looking for a download of the <strong>Harkenburg Texture Pack</strong>, head to <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/harkenburg-city-texture-pack/">https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/harkenburg-city-texture-pack/</a> for the official download links until I find time to customize this page with downloads and more fun info.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I promise I know a bit more HTML than basic P tags and headings, but like I said, what even is time anymore. Aye.</p>
